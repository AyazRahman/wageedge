                Migrant workers and Visa holders, including international
                students, have the same workplace rights as all other workers in
                Australia. Fair Work OMBUDSMAN (FWO) provides free legal advice
                and assistance to all workers to help them understand their
                rights like:

                An employee canâ€™t get into trouble or have their visa cancelled
