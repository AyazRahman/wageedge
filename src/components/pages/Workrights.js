              <p>
                Generally, an employer cannot deduct any money from your wages
                unless the deduction is:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>for your benefit, and you agree to it in writing or</li>
                <li>
                  authorised under a term of an award, agreement or Fair Work
                  Commission order or
                </li>
                <li>
                  authorised under Commonwealth, State or Territory law, or by
                  an order of a court.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This means that an employer generally cannot take money from
                your wages unless you agree and the deduction benefits you, or
                unless your industrial instrument permits it. For example, if
                you accidentally break something, the employer cannot deduct
                money from your wages. Further, an employer cannot force you to
                agree to a deduction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even if the deduction is authorised under a term in an award or
                agreement, the term has no effect if the deduction is directly,
                or indirectly, for the employer's benefit, or if the deduction
                is unreasonable.

                It is acceptable for your employer to pay you in cash as long as
                tax has been taken from your earnings and sent to the Australian
                Taxation Office (ATO). Generally, you should also be receiving
                superannuation. You should check your pay slip each time you are
                paid to make sure this is being done.

                'Cash in hand' is a term used to describe cash payments where

                As an international student, you can request flexible working

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Hours of work (eg. changes to start and finish times)</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                Before requesting flexible working arrangements you need to be
                working for the same employer at least 12 months. After this
                period you can request flexible arrangement if you:

              <h4>Additional Information</h4>
              <p>
                Employers and employees can enter into individual flexibility
                arrangements (IFAs) which alter the way a modern award or
                enterprise agreement applies to an employee. This can change the
                way some entitlements, such as penalty rates or allowances,
                apply in your employment.
              </p>
              <p>
                An employer cannot force you to enter into an IFA. If you feel
                that you are being pressured to do so, you should contact the
                Fair Work Ombudsman.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to create an IFA, the employer is required to ensure
                that you are better off overall than you would be normally under
                the award or agreement. This may mean that you receive
                additional benefits in one area to compensate for those changed
                in another area. If you believe that you are not better off
                overall, you should not enter into the IFA.

                The Fair Work Act 2009 protects employees against unlawful
                workplace discrimination. Unlawful workplace discrimination
                occurs when an employer takes adverse action against a person
                who is an employee or prospective employee because of the
                following attributes of the person:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>race</li>
                <li>colour</li>
                <li>sex</li>
                <li>sexual orientation</li>
                <li>age</li>
                <li>physical or mental disability</li>
                <li>marital status</li>
                <li>family or carer's responsibilities</li>
                <li>pregnancy</li>
                <li>religion</li>
                <li>political opinion</li>
                <li>national extraction or social origin</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Where an investigation finds that the employer has (or had)
                discriminatory practices that are linked to adverse actions for
                employees or prospective employees, the Fair Work Ombudsman may
                take enforcement action.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adverse action taken by an employer includes doing, threatening
                or organising any of the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>dismissing an employee</li>
                <li>injuring an employee in their employment</li>
                <li>altering an employee's position to their detriment</li>
                <li>discriminating between one employee and other employees</li>
                <li>refusing to employ a prospective employee</li>

              <h4>Parental leave</h4>
              <p>
                There are some cases that international students come to
                Australia and are expecting to have a child. If this is your
                case you should know that you have the right to take parental
                leave, even if is your partner who is going to give birth. Also,
                if you decide to adopt a child under 16 years old while you are
                studying in Australia you can take parental leave.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are entitled to 12 months of unpaid parental leave, and you
                can request an additional 12 months of leave if you need it.
                There are some conditions you need to know before request
                parental leave:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You have worked for your employer for at least 12 months
                </li>
                <li>
                  before the date or expected date of birth if the employee is
                  pregnant
                </li>
                <li>before the date of the adoption, or</li>
                <li>
                  when the leave starts (if the leave is taken after another
                  person cares for the child or takes parental leave)
                </li>
                <li>
                  have or will have responsibility for the care of a child.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                For casual employees to be eligible for unpaid parental leave
                they need to have:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  been working for their employer on a regular and systematic
                  basis for at least 12 months
                </li>
                <li>
                  a reasonable expectation of continuing work with the employer
                  on a regular and systematic basis had it not been for the
                  birth or adoption of a child.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Annual leave</h4>
              <p>
                All employees (except for casual employees) get paid annual
                leave. Full-time and part-time employees get 4 weeks of annual
                leave, based on their ordinary hours of work.
              </p>
              <h4>Public holidays</h4>
              <p>
                Public holidays can be different depending on the state or
                territory you work in. Itâ€™s important to know when public
                holidays are because employees can get different entitlements on
                these days. Go to the List of public holidays of Fairwork
                website for a full list of public holidays in your state or
                territory.

                A notice period is the length of time that an employee or

                employment, an employer has to give them written notice of their
                last day of employment. Redundancy happens when an employer

                Under Australian law, your rights are different depending on

              </p>
              <p>
                Full time employees work about 38 hour a week. If you are a full
                time employee you also get annual leave and paid sick leave as
                well as a number of other entitlements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Part time employees work less than 38 hours per week on average.
                If you are a part time employee you get the same benefits as a
                full time employee, at a rate in proportion to the amount of
                time you work. For example if you work one day per week, your
                leave entitlements are one fifth of the entitlements of someone
                who works five days per week.
              </p>
              <p>
                Casual employees have no guaranteed hours of work. As a casual
                employee your employer does not have to give you work, or they
                can ask you to work at short notice. Casual employees do not get

                Casual employees are entitled to casual loading - a higher

                getting leave entitlements.

                workers compensation insurance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Independent contractors run their own business. If you are an
                independent contractor, you donâ€™t have a minimum pay rate but
                instead negotiate payment as part of your contract. You must

                An employer is breaking the law if they tell you that you are an

                employment, including pay rates and days of work. Employment
                contracts should also set out whether someone is full-time,

                also be verbal (based on a spoken agreement between the employer
